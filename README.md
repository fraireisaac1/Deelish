# Deelish

## Team Project
Deelish was a website my team was tasked with creating for a project grade at West-Mec in the coding program. As voted by my teammates, I was assigned as the leader for this particular project, and I allocated each member their specific responsibilities so that we could split up the work and create the finished product.

## Purpose
This webpage is designed to have users enter and modify data in the form of recipes. Data is entered by the user with the use of forms on the webpage. The data the user enters is displayed on the homepage as recipes, and if the users opts to, they can include images of their dish so that the image can be displayed alongside the recipe as well. Not only that, but the user can also create an account with Deelish and enter their credentials to be stored in the backend of the project. The data is stored in .json files and is updated with the corresponding CRUD operators.

## Technologies Used and Why
* JavaScript: In preperation for upcoming quizes, tests, and certification exams, we were assigned to use JavaScript as the main language to create this webpage. In doing so we'd have enough knowledge of the language to pass the upcomming assessments.
* Express: This technology is what makes the CRUD operators possible within this project. Without Express, the user wouldn't be able to interact with the data aspect of the project.
* Node.js: A technology necessary to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser. Without it, we wouldn't have been able to run the code from the Visual Studio Code terminal where the project's code was kept.

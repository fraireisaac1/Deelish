# Captain's Mark Down File
Hello there, team!

# 10/1/2024 Journal Entry

## What did you accomplish today?
Today we were able to get the general schema and layout of the project in order. All the necessary folders, index files, js files, and json files are in place and ready to be utilized. On top of that, we were able to code some in a few of the files, such as the form file meant to take user credentials already being set up curtosy of Gabe. I myself have set up a fair amount of the index.js file as well.
## What is your role and responsibilities?
My role is Project Coordinator, so it's my responsibility to keep everyone on track, make sure everything gets done in time, as well as I work on some backend files.
## What do you hope to accomplish tomorrow?
I hope to get at least one endpoint functioning properly tomorrow, perhaps the /submit-form endpoint.
## What was your biggest challenge today?
Mainly just navigating the git shenanigans and getting everyone on the same repository.

## What new challenge arose today?
We had to create our develop branch as sort of a protytype of what the main branch would look like, then we had to push changes from our own personal branches to develop.
## What is 1 resource you are using to learn/research?
Past projects such as super-squad-2.0, and maybe other recipe websites to set a precedent for what ours would look like. Also, Mr. Morales proved to be invaluable in the advice he was able to give to us.
## What is 1 resource you are using to collaborate better with your teammates?
Mr. Morales is a resource I've been able to take use of to be more collaborative with my teammates, since his advice helped us all understand pushing and pulling changes to different branches a bit better. Our work flow became much more smooth once he cleared things up for us.

## Do you believe you are giving your best effort to the team?
I feel like I'm giving as good of an effort as I can to my team currently. I do my best to make sure we all keep on track and that our commits don't conflict with one another, as well as I help out Luis with the backend programming and making sure that our logic lines up with the logic on the front-end.
## What is one way you hope to improve your site by the end of the week?
Making all the pages link to one another for the website to feel cohesive. That way you can land on the homepage then navigate to any other page as you see fit.
## What is one technical challenge that is currently keeping you from moving forward in this project?
The prospect of implementing an account function sounds a bit daunting for us.
## What is 1 way you can support your team better moving forward?
Maybe making sure that we all know how we can be helping eachother, and constantly informing each other of what we're doing so we avoid redundancy.

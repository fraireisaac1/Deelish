# Daniel's Record

### Day 1

1. Today, I finished a quick outline sketch of the website, and asked the rest of my colleagues for approval on it. Everyone seems to agree it looks great!

2. I am in charge of the front end and making everything look appealing to the eye of the user. By that, I'm using HTML and CSS.

3. By tomorrow I hope to have at least a framework of the outline done, and maybe modify anything as I see fit.

4. Today my biggest challenge was dealing with my hunger, and getting everyone on the same page with the pushes because we got slightly jumbled on it.

### Day 2

1. One of the main challenges was how to work the CSS grid properly, but I'll manage myself out. I've worked with worse, and this is a pretty overcomable.

2. A very abundant resource I'm using is mostly W3Schools because it's concise and easy to understand.

3. A resource to collaborate better was basically just communicating our issues... and Mr. Morales.

### Day 3

1. Yes, I believe I'm doing my best effort because my ribs feel like they might shatter, and I don't know why. Also, because I've actually spent most the time locked in.

2. Probably finish what the thing is supposed to look like, but I think I've made actual good progress from what I've seen myself.

3. The `position:` thing, because I'm having to use it, and I sometimes forget which either `absolute` or `relative` does.

4. Actually speaking and being more communicative because I haven't spoken as much recently.

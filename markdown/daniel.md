# Daniel's Record

### Day 1

1. Today, I finished a quick outline sketch of the website, and asked the rest of my colleagues for approval on it. Everyone seems to agree it looks great!

2. I am in charge of the front end and making everything look appealing to the eye of the user. By that, I'm using HTML and CSS.

3. By tomorrow I hope to have at least a framework of the outline done, and maybe modify anything as I see fit.

4. Today my biggest challenge was dealing with my hunger, and getting everyone on the same page with the pushes because we got slightly jumbled on it.

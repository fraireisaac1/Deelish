        <p>My contribution to this project was as the Project Coordinator. During the stand up sessions at the beginning of each class period, I set up what we all were going to do for the day, and prioritized the tasks that we'd have to accomplish for the project to fulfill the requirements of the rubric. Next up, when it came to the git commands and the git branch functionality in general, I did my best to keep everyone pushing their changes in order and making sure that no merge errors took place. Otherwise, I assisted Luis in some of the work for the backend programming with JavaScript, such as coding the CRUD endpoints. Also, I assisted in styling and designing the form.html page. Now, when it came to error handling, it was more of a collective group effort that I contributed towards. Overall, I'm very proud of what we've been able to accomplish with the Deelish project. While I did my fair share to contribute to the final product, I must say that the overall effort was a group one. My group members were awesome in how supportive they were, and the experience was easily worth the struggle.
